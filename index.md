### Introduction

Coding Dojo session was first invented in Paris in 2004 by the XP (eXtreme
Programming) community.  The aim of these sessions is to enhance the coding
skills of attendees by doing very small exercises in a funny atmosphere.
Pretty much the same spirit as when you want to master a sport or martial art
like Judo, you need to practice some basic exercises with some Judo masters
before doing serious business like competitions.  There are usually two styles
of exercises:

* *Kata*: prepared by someone before the session and presented in front of the
  public or
* *Randori*: a more exploratory form of a Kata where the whole group
  participates in solving the problem.

All the code done during the sessions is available on
[github](http://www.github.com/) and released under the terms of the
[MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).
