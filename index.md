Welcome to Hanoi CodingDojo
===========================

**Next session will be organized June 4th 2011 at AUF/CNF (see below)**

Coding Dojo session was first invented in Paris in 2004 by the XP
(eXtreme Programming) community. The aim of these sessions is to
enhance the coding skills of attendees by doing some very small
exercises in a funny atmosphere. This is like when you want to
practice a sport like Judo, you need to practice some basic exercises
with some judo masters before doing serious business like
competitions.  There are usually two styles of exercises:

* Kata prepared by someone before the session and executed in front of
  the public or
* Randori, a more exploraty form of a Kata where the whole group
  participates.

All the code done during the sessions are available on
[github](http://www.github.com/) with a MIT licence.
